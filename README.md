# Defensive-Rating

This repository is dedicated to my Duffy Defensive Rating, which is a weifhted summation of three defensive metrics in baseball: Outs Above Average, Defensive Runs Saved, and my own Weighted Error statistic.
The two more commonly used metrics are given more weight while my statistic carries only about 20% of overall outcome. I have tinkered with win probabilty and expected run value in my statistic. 

The first code and plots shown in this will be for finding who is the best defensive first baseman in baseball over the past three years.
